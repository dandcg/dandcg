24 years building applications and infrastructure for regulated industries.<br/>
Full-stack .NET, Azure, Terraform — from database schema to cloud platform.

I've built systems processing £1B+ in financial remediation and cloud platforms<br/>
serving 700K+ patient records. As CTO of a startup I built the entire platform<br/>
from scratch, scaling to 1,500+ locations.

*I leave every system in a better state than I found it. Open to interesting problems.*
